# FEATURES DESCRIPTION
The features can be grouped into 4 macro groups:
- API calls
- surrounding actions
- type of attachment
- malware family

As regards the macro category of API calls, the columns involved are those ranging from the "CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent" column to the "SystemTimeToFileTime" column. These features represent a subset of the built-in Windows functions that are used by all processes within the operating system (not just malware).

The second macro category is made up of features ranging from the "appexception" column to the "wmiquery" column. Specifically, these features represent the actions that the malware can perform during its execution. For example, the “apicall” feature represents the number of times the malware made a call to one of the Windows built-in functions (APIs). Or, the "folder" feature represents the number of times the malware has performed an action on any folder within the operating system (delete, read, write, create).

The third macro category is made up of the features that go from the "xls" column to the "other_extension" column. This type of feature represents the malware file extension. In particular, how the malware was inserted as an attachment in the email blocked by FireEye.
This type of feature has been binarized so as to have a "1" in the column of the extension found and "0" in all the others.

The fourth macro category represents labels, the name of the malware.
The output was binarized in the same way as the third macro category.
